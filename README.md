# iWhisper

iWhisper is a tool that aims to help people who are struggling to speak. The main idea is to provide them an interface where they can choose couple of words to express themselves, and use Google's Text-to-Speech API to make the machine read the built sentence.

UI and the given Icons scale accordingly and user can zoom in/out by changing the grid size.
User can mark couple of frequently used words as "Favorites" and show only selected words.
User can move back and forth between selected words and delete one of them by simply clicking the icon on top.
Implemented using Java/Swing.
